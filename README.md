## Introduction

This is my sandbox, here I am god!

I'm going to put some old French texts up in transcription and translation. 

I think it will be fun... maybe?


## This will soon be links to the various texts I prepare.

- [Our sample site](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/): Maybe something Arthurian?
- [Fugitive Verses](http://fugitiverses.viraltexts.org/): Maybe Something liturgical?
- [mini lazarillo](http://minilazarillo.github.io/): I think I need a fablial (singular of fabliaux?) here? 
- [Making and Knowing](https://cu-mkp.github.io/GR8975-edition/): It better be good!
- [Daisy Miller: A Comedy in Three Acts](https://britaneeelizabeth.github.io/ed/texts/DaisyMillerPlay/): Hmmmmm...


## Hypothetical Features

- Scroll over dictionary?
- High quality manuscript facsimiles?
- Awesome sauce?


## Personal notes

I love to eat cheese!
